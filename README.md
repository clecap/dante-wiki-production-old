# dante-wiki-production

This repository is for an end user wanting to install DanteWiki.

# Requirements for DanteWiki

DanteWiki is based on two Docker images, so you need a possibility to run Docker images. A traditional
docker server is fine, but DanteWiki will also run on a medium-sized laptop. It consists of a web-server,
a PHP application process, which is a MediaWiki modification, and a number of latex processes. 
It uses extensive caching. It is not a microservice architecture and can make use of several CPUs
for speeding up reaction time.

We currently run the system on our development machine with 8 vCPUs, 8 GB Memory and 20 GB Disc and we are
studying performance to cut down on this which probably is massive overprovisioning.

**CPU:**  minimum 2 vCPUs, recommended 4 vCPUs
**MEMORY:** minimum 6GB, recommended 8 GB
**DISK:** 8-10 GB recommended

# Updating DanteWiki

For small updates you can execute Ã¹pdate-dante.sh`. 

It is good operational practice to make a backup of data before every update.
